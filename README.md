# Flask Web Application with Terraform, Ansible, and uWSGI

This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in infrastructure automation using Terraform and Ansible, along with web application development with Flask and uWSGI. It's designed to showcase my capabilities and provide a hands-on example of how I deploy and manage web applications in my homelab environment.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate:

* Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform

## Notes

* This project is meant for demonstration purposes and is not suitable for production use without further customization and hardening.
* Not included in this repo is the Jenkins pipeline that ties everything together. This passes important variables and executes the build steps.
* I did not create the original HTML/CSS, though I did modify them to fit my needs.
